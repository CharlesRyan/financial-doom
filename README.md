# Financial Doom Calculator üíÄüí∞

**üåê Live Demo: [https://financial-doom.netlify.app/](https://financial-doom.netlify.app/)**

This was a fun little weekend project to brush up on TypeScript best practices and create a financial planning tool that's hard to find elsewhere. In spite of the cheeky name and hyperbolic commentary, it's actually a genuinely useful retirement planning calculator.

## What is Financial Doom?

Financial Doom is just lighthearted retirement calculator. While most financial planning tools are dry and boring, this app delivers your financial reality with a dose of humor and some optional twists of fate. It performs legitimate retirement calculations based on compound interest, withdrawal rates, and realistic financial projections. The user also has the option to play with fate. After the financial projection is calculated, a button appears that, once clicked, randomly applies a financial scenario that could either be a windfall or a wipeout.

## Features

### Core Calculations
- **Retirement Planning**: Calculate how long your savings will last based on your desired spending
- **Compound Interest**: Accurate projections using configurable return rates (3-8% annually)
- **Monthly Contributions**: Factor in ongoing savings contributions
- **Withdrawal Rate Analysis**: Uses the 4% rule and other withdrawal rate calculations

### Unique Elements
- **Doom Level Assessment**: Get categorized into SAFE, CONCERNING, DOOMED, or CATASTROPHIC levels
- **Fortune Events**: Random life events that could impact your financial future (both positive and negative)
- **Sassy Messaging**: Brutally honest feedback about your financial situation
- **Interactive Sliders**: Smooth, responsive controls for adjusting return rates

## How It Works

1. **Input Your Data**: Enter your current age, retirement age, savings, monthly contributions, expected return rate, and desired annual spending
2. **Get Your Assessment**: The app calculates how many years your money will last and assigns you a "doom level"
3. **Experience Fortune**: Random events might modify your projections (because life happens!)
4. **Plan Accordingly**: Use the results to adjust your savings strategy

## Doom Level Categories

- **SAFE** (30+ years): You're financially secure! üéâ
- **CONCERNING** (20-30 years): Some adjustments needed üò∞
- **DOOMED** (10-20 years): Time for drastic changes! üíÄ
- **CATASTROPHIC** (<10 years): Emergency mode activated! üö®
